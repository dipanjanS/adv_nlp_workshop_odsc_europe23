![](https://i.imgur.com/2TQEhSS.png)


## Abstract: 

Being specialized in domains like computer vision and natural language processing is no longer a luxury but a necessity which is expected of any data scientist in todayâ€™s fast-paced world! With a hands-on and interactive approach, we will understand essential concepts in NLP along with extensive hands-on examples to master state-of-the-art tools, techniques and methodologies for actually applying NLP to solve real-world problems. We will specifically be focusing on deep learning and deep transfer learning models to learn and solve popular tasks using NLP including NER, Classification, Search / Information Retrieval, Summarization, Classification, Language Translation, Q&A systems using popular libraries like HuggingFace and the Python programming language.
